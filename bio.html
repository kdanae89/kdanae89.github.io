      <p>I'm extremely objective oriented. I'm an OOP - objective oriented person. Okay, jokes aside, it's true. I love technical thinking and adding the fact that I get to create amazing websites for people to enjoy just jazzes me up. I decided I wanted in, I wanted to build things that could impact a lot of people in great ways, so I looking into coding. I had done some fancy Myspace manipulation as a young person, and thought it was so cool. As I looked into the possiblility of spending the rest of my life doing something, I decided I wanted it to be this. I signed up for a bootcamp with General Assembly.</p>
